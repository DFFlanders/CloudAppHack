# Checklist for #CloudAppHack "Community Champion"

## The "Community Champion" is the person responsible for helping oragnise the long term health of and *Open* Cross-Cloud Application Developer community.  This person must be passionate for local community and willing to spend many a late night planning the next amazing event for the local community.  Their thirst for knowledge must be insatiable, and yet their willingness for someone else to learn before them -helping all- shall naturally take precendent.

Your objectives as the "pre-training coordinator" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * get to know the core community of hackers: who they are and what tech they passionatley use.
 * search and befriend the best of the best hackers
 * 3rd

NB by "hackers" we mean anyone who playfully makes life work for them in as fast and fun a way as possible (not necessarily a coder, devopps, sysadmin, appdev, marketeer, et al).

## Checklists for ROLE
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community.

## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from Guadalajara
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
