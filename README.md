If (after reading the above brochure), you are still keen on progressing, please contact OpenStack's Cloud Application Hackathon Working Group, which is filled with lovely people who have themselves run hackathons and can help provide advice, guidance, examples and mentoship to help you get going!  PS these checklists make for a great way to have a conversation with the AppHack-WG members and their individual expertises.
