## Lead Hacker Checklists for Hackathon Event

##The 'lead hacker' is reponsible for the overall success of the event.  You should be a well organised person, able to kindly delegate tasks and humbly ask for help. You will have run events before with an understanding for basic community principles: especially inclusion, kindness and 'a steady hand' when things get stressful.

Your objectives as the "Lead Hacker" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Assemble a team of event organisers who are passionate for building up your local community.
 * Organise weekly/fortnightly meetings to bring the event organising team together to communicate.
 * Answer questions daily, being on-call wherever you are needed.  Promote, promote, promote.
 * Be the cheerleader, help people, do everything you can to make the event a positive organised experience for everyone.

## Checklists for the 'Lead Hacker'
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks to make your event even better and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

Are you ready to help make the world a better place where apps can work on any open cloud?

 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
