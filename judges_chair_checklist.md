# Event Organiser Role: LEAD JUDGE and CHIEF ADVOCACY CHAIR for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The lead judge is responsible for recruiting and shperding the judges through the judging process.  Above all, the lead judge must prepare the judges to (not only pick the teams they think should win) but, to also advocate on a teams behalf to all the other participants.  All juges will be required to short list the best teams, but to also stand in front of the audience and recommend one of the teams to win, whereby the audience will select the final winner.  The judging process must run like clockwork as many teams need to be interviewed against the judging criteria in a very short period of time.  Also remember, that the moment which everyone will remember is the final winning team - you are responsible for this magic moment.

Your objectives as the "LEAD JUDGE and CHIEF ADVOCACY CHAIR" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Recruit judges (prize sponsors) to participate in a full day of judging, if not for the entire hackathon event.
 * Inform the judges, participants and your fellow event organisers how the judging process will work and what judging criteria will be used to select the winners.
 * Asure the prizes, judges and sponsors are able to liaise with the brightest and best participants.  One of the long term values achieved will be the new job opportunities which will arise.

## Checklists for ROLE
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

Are you ready to create a magical winning moment for all the competing teams?!
Ok then, let's get started :)

### Pre Event Checklist

Things to get done prior to the hackathon beginning:
- [ ] Attend regular event organiser meetings and ask for help rom fellow event organisers in finding judges/sponsors who will be able to provide prizes.
- [ ] Work with the OpenStack Foundation to assure a Foundation staff member is in attendance to oversee judging process. The Foundation can also connect you with previous LEAD JUDGES
- [ ] Liaise with the SPONSORSHIP CZAR to list likely sponsors who will also volonteer their time to be a judge.
- [ ] Create a nice looking flow diagram to show potential judges what their participatiion will involve in terms of selection criteria and judging process.  Is the judging going to be open or closed for spectators?
- [ ] Prepare a judging scorecard / spreadsheet which the judges can fill out as they evaluate each team.  If an online form, make sure judges bring a computer, otherwise you'll need paper and a data entry person.
- [ ] Arrange for the judges area to be ready for participants: you'll need presentation setup, snacks and sustenance for the judges with the VENUE MAGICIAN as there are no breaks while judging.  Warn the judges how there day will be very full.
- [ ] Schedule a video conference call (or face-to-face) meeting to go over final details with the judges, confirming the agenda and your flow diagram for the judging criteria and process.  Make them aware they will be on stage and be required to give a 60 second speech on which team they are giving their recommendation to as the best cloud application idea.
- [ ] Double check with judges that they know the time they MUST be in attendance, a missing judge can cause significant problems.  Have back-up judges!

### Event (in situ) Checklist

Tasks to achieve during the event:
- [ ] Give a presentation to all participants on "how to win the competition", outlining the judge process and criteria.  Work with your OpenStack Foundation Staff representative to assure oversight, fairness and code of conduct.
- [ ] Doublecheck: all judges are aware of how tight the timelines will be for the judging process.
- [ ] Arrange with the VOLONTEER CHAMPION to have 2-3 volonteers to help find and queue teams up 10minutes prior to their interview with the judges.
- [ ] Setup the judge interview area, including projector/tv, water, microphone (if open judge process).
- [ ] Setup an area where teams can sign-up for their timeslot to be interviewed by judges.  Be mindful of how many teams there are and how long they will need to present to the judges.
- [ ] Make sure judges are filling out their score cards correctly.
- [ ] Organise the judges into a final panel for selecting the shortlist of potential winners.
- [ ] Have each judge select the team they will represent on stage.  
- [ ]

 * Example from Guadalajara...
 * Interesting resource worth reading...
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this...
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat re judging: @FCTweedie 
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
