Are you ready to help make your event take off...?
Ok then, let's get going!

### Pre Event Checklist

Things to get done prior to the hackathon beginning:
- [ ] Attend regular event organiser meetings and ask for help rom fellow event organisers in finding judges/sponsors who will be able to provide prizes.
- [ ] Work with the OpenStack Foundation to assure a Foundation staff member is in attendance to oversee judging process. The Foundation can also connect you with previous LEAD JUDGES
- [ ] Liaise with the SPONSORSHIP CZAR to list likely sponsors who will also volonteer their time to be a judge.
- [ ] Create a nice looking flow diagram to show potential judges what their participatiion will involve in terms of selection criteria and judging process.  Is the judging going to be open or closed for spectators?
- [ ] Prepare a judging scorecard / spreadsheet which the judges can fill out as they evaluate each team.  If an online form, make sure judges bring a computer, otherwise you'll need paper and a data entry person.
- [ ] Arrange for the judges area to be ready for participants: you'll need presentation setup, snacks and sustenance for the judges with the VENUE MAGICIAN as there are no breaks while judging.  Warn the judges how there day will be very full.
- [ ] Schedule a video conference call (or face-to-face) meeting to go over final details with the judges, confirming the agenda and your flow diagram for the judging criteria and process.  Make them aware they will be on stage and be required to give a 60 second speech on which team they are giving their recommendation to as the best cloud application idea.
- [ ] Double check with judges that they know the time they MUST be in attendance, a missing judge can cause significant problems.  Have back-up judges!

### Event (in situ) Checklist

Tasks to achieve during the event:
- [ ] Give a presentation to all participants on "how to win the competition", outlining the judge process and criteria.  Work with your OpenStack Foundation Staff representative to assure oversight, fairness and code of conduct.
- [ ] Doublecheck: all judges are aware of how tight the timelines will be for the judging process.
- [ ] Arrange with the VOLONTEER CHAMPION to have 2-3 volonteers to help find and queue teams up 10minutes prior to their interview with the judges.
- [ ] Setup the judge interview area, including projector/tv, water, microphone (if open judge process).
- [ ] Setup an area where teams can sign-up for their timeslot to be interviewed by judges.  Be mindful of how many teams there are and how long they will need to present to the judges.
- [ ] Make sure judges are filling out their score cards correctly.
- [ ] Organise the judges into a final panel for selecting the shortlist of potential winners.
- [ ] Have each judge select the team they will represent on stage.  
- [ ] 

### Post Event Checklist

## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from Guadalajara
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
