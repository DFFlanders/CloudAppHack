# Sponsorship Czar for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The 'sponsorship czar' is reponsible for attracting the funding and sponsorship prizes which will enable the event to happen!  The best part is that vendors love to sponsor prizes, so you just need to find a sponsor who shares your interest in build cross-cloud apps!  

Your objectives as the "sponsorship czar" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Create a sponsorship prospectus
 * Oversee the judges, prizes and liaise with the OpenStack foundation to assure comliance with community guidelines.
 * ... etc

## Checklists for ROLE
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

Are you ready to help make your event take off...?

## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from Guadalajara
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
