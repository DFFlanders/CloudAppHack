# Sponsorship Czar for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The 'sponsorship czar' is reponsible for attracting the funding and sponsorship prizes which will enable the event to happen!  The best part of this roles, is that vendors love to sponsor prizes so they can be on stage with winners.  Your challenge: find a sponsor who shares in the spirit of openness, cross-cloud apps and changing the world! #simplz ;-)

Your objectives as the "sponsorship czar" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Help create the hype and overall theme of the event which sponsors will want to sponsor, what is the theme of the event which will bring the community together?!
 * Forecast potenitial expenses, distribute them accordingly in terms of venue, infrastructure, marketing, meals and prizes.
 * Oversee the judges, prizes and liaise with the OpenStack foundation to assure comliance with community guidelines.
 * Spend time with the sponsors so they understand the long term value of the community and why they want to participate in this event and the next events.

## Checklists of things to do for the Sponsorship Czar
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

Are you ready to help make your event take off...?
Ok then, let's get going!

### Pre Event Checklist

Things to get done prior to the hackathon beginning:
- [ ] Contact the OpenStack foundation to be introduced to other Sponsorship Czars so you can get helpful advice (and make new friends!)
- [ ] Work with the "Lead Event Hacker" to create clear messaging (a tag line for your event) which everyone will understand and sponsors will know why and what they are funding - be creative in your themes(prizes) it will get you more sponsorship!
- [ ] Build out a sponsorship prospectus which inspires sponsors, but also gives them the data they will need to justify the costs, e.g. cost per attendee, value to attendee, sponsorship competition (what other companies want to sponsor this event and why), total package value (list of what sponsor gets from funding), their crowing moment (their moment on stage when everyone will hear the message they want to give), the cause and their beleif for sponsoring something that will change the world.
- [ ] OpenStack sponsors want new talent, how is the hackathon going to give them access to potentially hiring new talent?  Chat with your OpenStack Foundation liaison for ideas.
- [ ] Know when and who to ask for sponsorship.  If asking enterprise companies ask about their Q1 and Q4 budgets.  Approach local Telcos in your area (they love OpenStack).  Approach Government organisation as they love any prize where they can get citizens hacking on government data.   Universities are also good to ask if there is a research project prize which could help their scientists.
- [ ] Engate with the "Tech Analysts" (The Register, TechCrunch, etc) who are happy to help advertise the event and give it legitimacy which sponsors will want to see.  Engage your OpenStack Foudnation Liaison to help provide introductions.
- [ ] Sign Sponsorship contract
- [ ] 5th
- [ ] 6th
- [ ] Help work with the lead judge to assign judges who will be fair and represent the sponsorship prizes.

## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from Guadalajara
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
