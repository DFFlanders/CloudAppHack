# Description Pre-Hackathon Application Trainning Coordinator

Your objective as the "pre-training coordinator" (if you choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Recruit teams in the build-up to the hackathon, encouraging well rounded teams including CEO, CTO, AppDev, DevOpps, UX, CMO, etc.
 * setup 3-6 pre-training activities which will help teams practice the new open cloud app dev skills they will need to compete in the hackathon, i.e. every wednesday night for a month meet at the local pub to learn: rkt containers... sdk shade for openstack... swift storage rest apis... node.js for cloud mobile apps... etc.
 * Encourage individuals (who do not have a team) to either join a team or create a new team.  Plan "ice-breaker" activities as part of the pre-training events.

You will be working closely with the "team registration monarch" who will also be looking to figure out how best to enable individuals to find a team!  This very important as the OpenStack community is really big on inclusion!  Diversity of opinions can be an amazing thing if you can find the right team combination.
