# Description Pre-Hackathon Training Coordinator

Your objective as the "pre-training coordinator":

 * Recruit teams in the build-up to the hackathon, encouraging well rounded teams with different skillsets.
 * Setup pre-training activities (the month prior to the event) which will help teams practice the new open cloud app dev skills they will need to compete in the hackathon, i.e. every wednesday night for a month meet at the local pub to learn foobar.
 * Encourage individuals (who do not have a team) to either join a team or create a new team.  Plan "ice-breaker" activities as part of the pre-training events.
 * Bonus points: collect feedback from the teams on what other training they would like to have for future hackathons.

You will be working closely with the ["team registration monarch"](/team_registration_monarch_checklist.md) who will also be looking to figure out how best to enable individuals to find a team.  The OpenStack community loves inclusion.  Diversity of opinions can be an amazing thing if you can find the right team combination.
