# A Wrangler of Mentors for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The 'Mentors Wrangler' is one of the most important jobs of the Hackathon.  It is the mentors who will roam the halls of the hackathon being the "substitute superstar" which any team may call upon for help!  All hackathon teams will fail at some point and it is the mentor who must come to their rescue.  As the wrangler/gatherer/shepherd of the mentors, you must know the skills and capabilities of many great technicians, from: AppDev, DevOpps, SysAdmin, UX, Pitch Artists, User Testers, Techncial integrators, and everyone in between whom you can find to be a mentor.  Ideally you can recruit at least 1 mentor for every three teams accross a diversity of skills.

Your objectives as the "XXXXXXXXXX" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * 
 * 2nd 
 * 3rd

## Checklists for ROLE
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from [Guadalajara](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHJSGsEouiZhEoJ-xJ2FlmK1jx9UBjwT9D6VJh8gX9k/pub)
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
