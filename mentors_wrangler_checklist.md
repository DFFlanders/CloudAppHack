# A Wrangler of Mentors for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The 'Mentors Wrangler' is one of the most important jobs of the Hackathon. Your job = recruit a mentor team! It is the mentors you recruit who will roam the halls of the hackathon being the "substitute team player" which any team may call upon for help!  All hackathon teams will faulter at some point and it is the mentor who must come to their rescue.  As the wrangler (aka gatherer/shepherd) of the mentors, you must find and know the skills of many great technicians, from: AppDev, DevOpps, SysAdmin, UX, Pitch Artists, User Testers, Techncial integrators, and anyone else who likes apps!  Ideally you can recruit at least 1 mentor for every three teams accross a diversity of skills.

Your objectives as the 'Mentor Wrangler' (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Recruit, befriend, empower and entice any known "super tech talent" to come and volonteer their time as a mentor.  Hint: the best hackers at the event should be mentors, not participants ;-)
 * Inspire mentors as to why sharring their knowledge and skills is an amazing and truly good thing to do.
 * Make the hackathon a game for your mentors so they enjoy the event and want to help your community grow.

## Checklists for ROLE
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].  See the bottom of this page for examples from other hackathons.

Are you ready to help birth a new world of community based cross-cloud apps...?
Of course you are, this hackathon is going to make memories!

### Pre Event Checklist

Things to get done prior to the hackathon beginning:
- [ ] Create a guide for mentors which explains the role and what they will be expected to do, before, during and after the event (see examples at the bottom of this page).
- [ ] Recruit mentors for a wide range of skills diversity (AppDev, DevOpps, UX, SysAdmin, CTO, CIO, CMO, etc.). Have mentors who are going to attend the event in person and also mentors who will be availabile online.
- [ ] Have mentors create a profile for what kinds of things they can help do, enable them to share this profile with the other event organisers and participants before the event.
- [ ] Work with the "Training Sensei" to prepare trainings, encourage mentors to give trainings to show off their skills and how they will be able to help teams perform.
- [ ] Create a roster, schedule and presentation for when people will be mentorring, don't expect them to work the whole time. Provide shifts and make sure they get to enjoy the fun, food and frivolity of the event as well!
- [ ] Schedule a meet and greet with all the mentors so they can get to know each other before the event, have a little party for just the mentors to make them feel special and explain all the things!

### Event (in situ) Checklist

Tasks to achieve during the event:
- [ ] Agree a way to communicate with mentors throughout the event so you can keep everynoe up to date as they work with different teams, i.e. a slack channel, twitter direct messages, etc.

 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
