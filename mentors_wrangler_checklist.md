# A Wrangler of Mentors for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The 'Mentors Wrangler' is one of the most important jobs of the Hackathon.  It is the mentors who will roam the halls of the hackathon being the "substitute superstar" which any team may call upon for help!  All hackathon teams will fail at some point and it is the mentor who must come to their rescue.  As the wrangler/gatherer/shepherd of the mentors, you must know the skills and capabilities of many great technicians, from: AppDev, DevOpps, SysAdmin, UX, Pitch Artists, User Testers, Techncial integrators, and everyone in between whom you can find to be a mentor.  Ideally you can recruit at least 1 mentor for every three teams accross a diversity of skills.

Your objectives as the "XXXXXXXXXX" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Recruit, befriend, recruit and plead with any known super talents to come and volonteer their time as a mentor.
 * Inspire mentors as to why sharring their knowledge and skills is an amazing thing to do!
 * Make the Hackathon a game for your mentors so they enjoy the event and want to do it again.

## Checklists for ROLE
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

Are you ready to help make your event take off...?
Ok then, let's get going!

### Pre Event Checklist

Things to get done prior to the hackathon beginning:
- [ ] Create a guide for mentors which explains the role and what they will be expected to do, before, during and after the event.
- [ ] Recruit mentors for their skill diversity (AppDev, DevOpps, UX, SysAdmin, CTO, CIO, CMO, etc.), availability (online help, face-to-face help, before event, during event, after event), etc.
- [ ] Have mentors create a profile for what kinds of things they can help do, enable them to share this profile with the other event organisers and participants be that via email/slack/web/etc.
- [ ] Work with the "Training Sensei" to prepare trainings, encourage mentors to give trainings to show off their skills and what they will be able to help teams do.
- [ ] Schedule a meet and greet with all the mentors so they can get to know each other before the event, have a little party for just the mentors to make them feel special and explain all the things!
- [ ] Create a roster and schedule for when people will be mentorring, don't expect them to work the whole time. Provide shifts and make sure they get to enjoy the fun, food and frivolity of the event as well!

 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
