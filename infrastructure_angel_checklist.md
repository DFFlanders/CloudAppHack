# Digital Infrastructure Angel (cloud, wifi, power and video) for your Cloud Application Hackathon

## The 'Infrastructure Angel' is the ultimate hardware hacker, able to leap firewalls and 

Your objective as the "digital infrastructure angle" (if you so choose to accept them...[1]):
 * Assure cloud, wifi and power are on tap throughout the events, including the pre-training events and hackathon.
 * Inform participants of what resources they should expect to have and what they should bring with them.  Be ready for the main event days as the Hackathon doesn't happen without cloud, wifi and power.
 * Assure the cloud as a resource is available for future use by the community so the cloud app developer community can conitnue to grow.

## Checklists for 'Infrastructure Angel'
The below checklists are intended to provide the minimum viable set of tasks which will need to be completed for the hackathon.  Naturally, you will add on additional tasks yourself and we would highly encourage you to create your own checklists and share them back with the community[1].

Good luck and may the force be with you.

## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from Guadalajara
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.
 * A helpful person worth contacting and having a chat.
 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
