## Additional Resources, Examples and Precedents

 * Example from Taipei
 * Example from Guadalajara
 * Interesting resource worth reading.
 * Some precedents of how other open communities do this.

 * Why use checklists?  Humans are not great at remembering stuff, this is how mistakes happen, people forget things when they are in stressful situations (like events), checklists are great for focusing the mind and result in significant productivity gains.  Read more about this in a book caled, 'The Checklist Manifesto'.
